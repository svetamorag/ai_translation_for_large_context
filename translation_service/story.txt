Beep was a shiny robot built to stack heavy boxes. Clank, clank, stack. That was his only job.

But Beep secretly loved pretty things. One day, he found a tiny seed on the gray factory floor. He didn't crush it. Instead, he scooped it up gently with his cold metal claw. He planted it in an old oil can and watered it every day.

Soon, a bright yellow flower bloomed. Beep’s gears whirred with joy. He wasn't just a machine anymore; he was a gardener. The factory was gray, but Beep’s corner was beautiful.
